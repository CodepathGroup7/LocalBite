# Evaluation of Top 3 Ideas:
## 1. Family-Owned Restaurant App Idea - LocalBite
- **Description**: In the competitive restaurant landscape, family-owned establishments often face challenges in attracting and retaining customers, especially during their initial stages of operation. To address this, we propose "LocalBite", a mobile application tailored specifically for newly opened family-owned restaurants.
- **Category:** Local Restaurants/Business
- **Mobile:** For the creation of the restaurant profile, pictures of the restaurant as well as menu items can be added to attract customers all from your phone. Those looking for new restaurants to eat at can also use their phone to browse locations on the move
- **Story:** LocalBite serves as a comprehensive platform that empowers local restaurants to enhance visibility, promote special events, and cultivate meaningful connections with their communities. Through intuitive features, including event promotion, exclusive discounts, and interactive engagement tools, our app enables restaurants to showcase their unique offerings and reach a broader audience.
- **Market:** Local restaurants face challenges in attracting customers and growing bigger. Let's take Redmond, WA for example, there are around 72000 residents, and it has a tech savy population based on the companies around Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond. There would be around 200 family owned restaurants and Redmond has a strong sense of community. So, people usually go to these kind of food joints.
- **Habit:** An average american takes out/dine in about 4.2 times per week, so people would use this app atleast 1 time per week and the average users would be mainly consuming through the app and the restaurants owners would be creating through the app.
- **Scope:** The user will be able to view nearby restaurants through the app and view their events or discount offers and register for events. The restaurants will be able to create events and discount coupons and view participation.

## 2. Trip Sharing Idea - VoyageVibes
In a world where travel is both a passion and a way of life, "VoyageVibes" revolutionizes the way individuals plan and experience trips. Our mobile app offers a platform for travelers to share their trip itineraries, invite like-minded adventurers to join their journeys, and forge meaningful connections along the way.

- **Description**: Even in 2024, many college students, international students and workers, as well as those who cannot afford a vehicle struggle to plan big trips to get groceries, travel far, and visit locations conveniently. Sometimes busses and trains are not the most reliable as they are susceptible to delays and forces the user to walk in rain and snow. Our app VoyageVibes promotes carpooling and ridesharing and allows users to plan in advance shared and like minded activities that require a car.  
- **Category:** Travel/Ridesharing
- **Mobile:** Users should be able to look at meeting locations on a map of where a car will pick up everyone for the trip. Notifications should be given the riders when the driver has arrived at a certain location. The app should also allow all riders to be able to chat with one another while on the move to communicate necessary details and items to bring. 
- **Story:** Bob has trouble having to buy gallon milk and many other meat products at the grocery. He has to bring shopping bags as well as a backpack to fit everything and walk to the bus station in the freezing cold. With our app we are able to have other drivers who want to go shopping to pick Bob up and rideshare to the location and back. 
- **Market:** Our app relies on the kindness and resourcefulness of other drivers and riders who enjoy other people's company. While apps like Lyft, Uber and Taxis exist, those are paid and our app focuses towards those who are not as financially well off as well as forming genuine connections. 
- **Habit:** The Average American travels 3.8 miles to the grocery store, and food is always needed. Trips to run errands will always come up for the average person as well. Ways to get there conveniently, safely and reliably will always be in the top of a person's mind. Users will be on the lookout to check our app for people who are offering ridesharing in their location and time.
- **Scope:** V1 would implement drivers being able to host trips. V2 would allow others to join, and create lists of items to bring for a trip or places they will go. V3 would implement chatting features and GPS and location. 
 
## 3. Book Sharing Idea
- **Description:** "BookShare" is a mobile app designed to create a community-driven network of book sharing and exchange. The app allows users to donate books by simply snapping a photo, earn points for donations, and use accumulated points to acquire books from others in the network. By facilitating book sharing and connecting readers, BookShare aims to promote sustainability, foster a love for reading, and build a vibrant community of book enthusiasts.
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for taking pictures and confirming the donation of books, if we have a website it will only for viewing the recently up for donation books.
- **Story:** Allows user to share their old books and lend some new books from someone else by trading points.
- **Market:** Any person who have paperback books can use this app, and people who want to read books. To monteize the app, we are thinking of gamifying the experience by use of points gained by donations and reduced by lending. And add extra points using payment. 
- **Habit:** People usually have a habit of putting their books on shelf and let it collect dust to never see the light of the day again. So, this app can help get the dust off of those books and get someone in the habit of reading books.
- **Scope:** V1 would allow users to create profiles, view the books up for donation, and donate a book, chat with the reciever and confirm the location of their meet to donate the book, and send a confirmation of book by clicking a photo and getting points added to their user profile.
